API Changes
***********

* Driver APIs now return ``-ENOSYS`` if optional functions are not implemented.
  If the feature is not supported by the hardware ``-ENOTSUP`` will be returned.
  Formerly ``-ENOTSUP`` was returned for both failure modes, meaning this change
  may require existing code that tests only for that value to be changed.

* The :c:func:`wait_for_usb_dfu` function now accepts a ``k_timeout_t`` argument instead of
  using the ``CONFIG_USB_DFU_WAIT_DELAY_MS`` macro.

* Added disconnect reason to the :c:func:`disconnected` callback of :c:struct:`bt_iso_chan_ops`.

* Align error handling of :c:func:bt_l2cap_chan_send and
  :c:func:bt_iso_chan_send so when an error occur the buffer is not unref.

* Added c:func:`lwm2m_engine_delete_obj_inst` function to the LwM2M library API.

Deprecated in this release

* :c:macro:`DT_CLOCKS_LABEL_BY_IDX`, :c:macro:`DT_CLOCKS_LABEL_BY_NAME`,
  :c:macro:`DT_CLOCKS_LABEL`, :c:macro:`DT_INST_CLOCKS_LABEL_BY_IDX`,
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_CLOCKS_LABEL_BY_NAME`, and
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_CLOCKS_LABEL` was deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`DT_CLOCKS_CTLR` and variants.

* :c:macro:`DT_PWMS_LABEL_BY_IDX`, :c:macro:`DT_PWMS_LABEL_BY_NAME`,
  :c:macro:`DT_PWMS_LABEL`, :c:macro:`DT_INST_PWMS_LABEL_BY_IDX`,
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_PWMS_LABEL_BY_NAME`, and
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_PWMS_LABEL` was deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`DT_PWMS_CTLR` and variants.

* :c:macro:`DT_IO_CHANNELS_LABEL_BY_IDX`,
  :c:macro:`DT_IO_CHANNELS_LABEL_BY_NAME`,
  :c:macro:`DT_IO_CHANNELS_LABEL`,
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_IO_CHANNELS_LABEL_BY_IDX`,
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_IO_CHANNELS_LABEL_BY_NAME`, and
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_IO_CHANNELS_LABEL` were deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`DT_IO_CHANNELS_CTLR` and variants.

* :c:macro:`DT_DMAS_LABEL_BY_IDX`,
  :c:macro:`DT_DMAS_LABEL_BY_NAME`,
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_DMAS_LABEL_BY_IDX`, and
  :c:macro:`DT_INST_DMAS_LABEL_BY_NAME` were deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`DT_DMAS_CTLR` and variants.

* USB HID specific macros in ``<include/usb/class/usb_hid.h>`` are deprecated
  in favor of new common HID macros defined in ``<include/usb/class/hid.h>``.

* USB HID Kconfig option USB_HID_PROTOCOL_CODE is deprecated.
  USB_HID_PROTOCOL_CODE does not allow to set boot protocol code for specific
  HID device. USB HID API function usb_hid_set_proto_code() can be used instead.

* USB HID class API is changed by removing get_protocol/set_protocol and
  get_idle/set_idle callbacks. These callbacks are redundant or do not provide
  any additional value and have led to incorrect usage of HID class API.

* The ``CONFIG_OPENOCD_SUPPORT`` Kconfig option has been deprecated in favor
  of ``CONFIG_DEBUG_THREAD_INFO``.

* Disk drivers (``disk_access_*.c``) are moved to ``drivers/disk`` and renamed
  according to their function. Driver's Kconfig options are revised and renamed.
  SDMMC host controller drivers are selected when the corresponding node
  in devicetree is enabled. Following application relevant Kconfig options
  are renamed: ``CONFIG_DISK_ACCESS_RAM`` -> `CONFIG_DISK_DRIVER_RAM`,
  ``CONFIG_DISK_ACCESS_FLASH`` -> `CONFIG_DISK_DRIVER_FLASH`,
  ``CONFIG_DISK_ACCESS_SDHC`` -> `CONFIG_DISK_DRIVER_SDMMC`.
  Disk API header ``<include/disk/disk_access.h>`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``<include/storage/disk_access.h>``.

* :c:func:`flash_write_protection_set()`.

* The ``CONFIG_NET_CONTEXT_TIMESTAMP`` is removed as it was only able to work
  with transmitted data. The same functionality can be achieved by setting
  ``CONFIG_NET_PKT_RXTIME_STATS`` and ``CONFIG_NET_PKT_TXTIME_STATS`` options.
  These options are also able to calculate the RX & TX times more accurately.
  This means that support for the SO_TIMESTAMPING socket option is also removed
  as it was used by the removed config option.

* The device power management (PM) APIs and data structures have been renamed
  from ``device_pm_*`` to ``pm_device_*`` since they are not device APIs but PM
  subsystem APIs. The same applies to enumerations and definitions, they now
  follow the ``PM_DEVICE_*`` convention. Some other API calls such as
  ``device_set_power_state`` and ``device_get_power_state`` have been renamed to
  ``pm_device_state_set`` and ``pm_device_state_get`` in order to align with
  the naming of other device PM APIs.

* The following functions, macros, and structures related to the kernel
  work queue API:

  * :c:func:`k_work_pending()` replace with :c:func:`k_work_is_pending()`
  * :c:func:`k_work_q_start()` replace with :c:func:`k_work_queue_start()`
  * :c:struct:`k_delayed_work` replace with :c:struct:`k_work_delayable`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_init()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_init_delayable`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_submit_to_queue()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_schedule_for_queue()` or
    :c:func:`k_work_reschedule_for_queue()`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_submit()` replace with :c:func:`k_work_schedule()`
    or :c:func:`k_work_reschedule()`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_pending()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_delayable_is_pending()`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_cancel()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_cancel_delayable()`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_remaining_get()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_delayable_remaining_get()`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_expires_ticks()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_delayable_expires_get()`
  * :c:func:`k_delayed_work_remaining_ticks()` replace with
    :c:func:`k_work_delayable_remaining_get()`
  * :c:macro:`K_DELAYED_WORK_DEFINE` replace with
    :c:macro:`K_WORK_DELAYABLE_DEFINE`

Drivers and Sensors
*******************

* ADC

* Audio

* Bluetooth

  * The Kconfig option ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TO_HOST_UART_DEV_NAME`` was removed.
    Use the :ref:`zephyr,bt-c2h-uart chosen node <devicetree-chosen-nodes>`
    directly instead.

* CAN

* Clock Control

* Console

* Counter

* Crypto

* DAC

* Debug

* Display

* DMA

* EEPROM

* Entropy

* ESPI

* Ethernet

* Flash

  * flash_write_protection_set() has been deprecated and will be removed in
    Zephyr 2.8. Responsibility for write/erase protection management has been
    moved to the driver-specific implementation of the flash_write() and
    flash_erase() API calls. All in-tree flash drivers have been updated,
    and the protect implementation removed from their API tables.
    During the deprecation period user code invoking
    flash_write_protection_set() will have no effect, but the flash_write() and
    flash_erase() driver shims will wrap their calls with calls to the protect
    implementation if it is present in the API table.
    Out-of-tree drivers must be updated before the wrapping in the shims is
    removed when the deprecation period ends.

* GPIO

  * :c:struct:`gpio_dt_spec`: a new structure which makes it more convenient to
    access GPIO configuration in the :ref:`devicetree <dt-guide>`.
  * New macros for initializing ``gpio_dt_spec`` values:
    :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET_BY_IDX`, :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET_BY_IDX_OR`,
    :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET`, :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET_OR`,
    :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_INST_GET_BY_IDX`,
    :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_INST_GET_BY_IDX_OR`,
    :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_INST_GET`, and :c:macro:`GPIO_DT_SPEC_INST_GET_OR`
  * New helper functions for using ``gpio_dt_spec`` values:
    :c:func:`gpio_pin_configure_dt`, :c:func:`gpio_pin_interrupt_configure_dt`
  * Remove support for ``GPIO_INT_*`` flags in :c:func:`gpio_pin_configure()`.
    The feature has been deprecated in the Zephyr 2.2 release. The interrupt
    flags are now accepted by :c:func:`gpio_pin_interrupt_configure()`
    function only.

* Hardware Info

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Improved support for additional toolchains:

* Devicetree

  - :c:macro:`DT_COMPAT_GET_ANY_STATUS_OKAY`: new macro

* West

  * Improve bossac runner.  Added legacy mode option into extended SAM-BA
    bootloader selection.  This extends compatibility between Zephyr and
    some Arduino IDE bootloaders.


Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Disk

* Management

  * MCUmgr

  * updatehub

* Settings

* Random

* POSIX subsystem

* Power management

  * ``device_pm_control_nop`` has been removed in favor of ``NULL`` when device
    PM is not supported by a device. In order to make transition easier for
    out-of-tree users a macro with the same name is provided as an alias to
    ``NULL``. The macro is flagged as deprecated to make users aware of the
    change.

* Logging

* LVGL

* Shell

* Storage

* Tracing

  * ``CONFIG_TRACING_CPU_STATS`` was removed in favor of
    ``CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS`` which provides per thread statistics. The
    same functionality is also available when Thread analyzer is enabled with
    the runtime statistics enabled.

* Debug

* OS

  * Reboot functionality has been moved to ``subsys/os`` from ``subsys/power``.
    A consequence of this movement is that the ``<power/reboot.h>`` header has
    been moved to ``<sys/reboot.h>``. ``<power/reboot.h>`` is still provided
    for compatibility, but it will produce a warning to inform users of the
    relocation.

HALs
****

* HALs are now moved out of the main tree as external modules and reside in
  their own standalone repositories.


Trusted Firmware-m
******************

* Synchronized Trusted-Firmware-M module to the upstream v1.3.0 release.
* Configured QEMU to run Zephyr samples and tests in CI on mps2_an521_nonsecure
  (Cortex-M33 Non-Secure) with TF-M as the secure firmware component.
* Added Kconfig options for selecting the desired TF-M profile and build type
* Added Kconfig options for enabling the desired TF-M secure partitions
* Added a new sample to run the PSA tests with Zephyr
* Added a new sample to run the TF-M regression tests using the Zephyr build system
* Added support for new platforms

   * BL5340 DVK
   * STM32L562E DK


Documentation

Tests and Samples
*****************

* Twister's ``dt_compat_enabled_with_alias()`` test case filter was deprecated
  in favor of a new ``dt_enabled_alias_with_parent_compat()`` filter. The old
  filter is still supported, but it may be removed in a future release.

  To update, replace uses like this:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     filter: dt_compat_enabled_with_alias("gpio-leds", "led0")

  with:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     filter: dt_enabled_alias_with_parent_compat("led0", "gpio-leds")
